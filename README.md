# Swire's Product Demand Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project is designed to accurately forecast the demand for Swire's limited-release products. By predicting sales volumes accurately, Swire can prevent overproduction and out-of-stocks, ensuring optimal production quantities that align with consumer demand trends.

## Business Problem
The primary challenge is to develop robust predictive models using historical sales data to forecast product demand effectively, which will help Swire to enhance revenue growth and operational efficiency.

## Solution Overview
Our approach combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) with several predictive modeling techniques, including linear regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees, and ARIMA forecasting implemented in R to determine future product demand.

## Business Value
The project enables Swire to minimize production costs and optimize inventory levels, leading to better resource management and enhanced profitability.

## Challenges Encountered
- Dealing with sparse data for some product categories was challenging for model training.
- Balancing technical model complexity with ease of interpretation for non-technical stakeholders was critical.

## Learnings
The project enhanced our understanding of advanced forecasting techniques and their application in solving real-world business problems. It also underscored the importance of teamwork and effective communication in data science projects.

## Writing Standards
We ensured clear, well-commented notebooks, insightful visualizations with appropriate titles and labels, and thorough interpretation of results to support business decision-making.
